# crusada-project

This repo is a de-identified version of the project I worked on with the Center for U.S. Latino HIV/AIDs Substance Abuse (CRUSADA) organization. 

This project contains useful R function such as wrangling, merging, and pivoting multiple data sets. This repo also contains some basic analytical skills needed to perform exploratory analysis on repeated measures data. 

This repo is very beginner R friendly and packages from the Tidyverse, Flextables, and Haven.
