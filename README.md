# crusada-project

This repo is a de-identified version of the project I worked on with the Center for U.S. Latino HIV/AIDs Substance Abuse (CRUSADA) organization. 

This project contains useful R function such as wrangling, merging, and pivoting multiple data sets. This repo also contains some basic analytical skills needed to perform exploratory analysis on repeated measures data. 

This repo is very beginner R friendly and packages from the Tidyverse, Flextables, and Haven. 

in this repo you will find three main files, each of which have different stages of this project:

- `raw-cleaing` has some simple data exploration
- `bivariate-full-creation` is the beginging stages of a Bivariate vs. full model table 
- `raw-tables` is the raw output of flextables created from the model
